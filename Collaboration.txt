### Steps to collaborating using GitHub

1. Lead author pushes committed code to GitHub
2. Co-author navigates to online repository (e.g. github.com/lead_author/repos)
3. Click 'Clone or download' button, this will download the files (in a zip folder) to your remote desktop
4. Edit the files as necessary
